    <string name="dummy_content">Examples of fossilised behaviour include dietary information (wear traces on teeth and stable isotopes) and trace fossils indicating locomotor mode (footprints). The signature of a behavioural lead would be an observed shift in behaviour from one horizon (or species) to another, followed later by a morphological change relating to function. Fossil case studies that suggest a behavioural role in evolution include: feeding shifts in finely resolved sequences of vertebrates, ranging from freshwater fish to terrestrial ungulates locomotion changes crucial to major evolutionary transitions in the origin of tetrapods, birds and humans</string>
